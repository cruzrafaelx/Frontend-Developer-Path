1. remove bullet points from <ul>

ul{
 list-style-type: none;
}

2. gap

puts a gap between flex elements

gap: 5px;

3. li{
    cursor: pointer;
}


4. margin: auto; on flex children.  

margin: auto 0 0 auto;

This puts the flex child to the bottom right of the flex parent.

5. role="img" & aria-label=""
- if you do not have an <img> tag and have an image as a background, you can use the role: attribute to the container where the image background is, togethere with the aria-label attribute to describe the photo being shown.

6. CSS Position Property: relative & absolute

A. Position Absolute: positioning elements on top of everything else. It does not recognize containers. So setting Top: 0 and Left: 0, will put the element on top left of the window and not the container.

But, if we want to have the absolutely positioned element, we need to se the psoition of the parent element to relative. 

7. Whitespace below images

- In this case you can use the following solution:

img {
  display: block;
  vertical-align: bottom; /* or middle, or top */
}

The reason why images have a whitespace below them are because they are inline-elements. This was made for letters like y, or g so they dont overlap other letters below them.
