1. Fetch

Basic fetch syntax:

fetch("https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random")
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))

In JavaScript, a fetch request is a modern API for making HTTP requests, typically used to retrieve data from a server or send data to a server from a web application. The fetch API is promise-based, which means it uses promises to handle asynchronous operations, making it easier to work with asynchronous code.

response.json()
This converts the JSON Data to JS data.
