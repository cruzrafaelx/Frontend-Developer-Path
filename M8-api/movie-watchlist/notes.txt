1. DomContentLoaded

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    // Your code here
    // Access the element with id "add-btn" here
    const addBtn = document.getElementById("add-btn");
    // Continue with your logic...
});

By wrapping your code inside the DOMContentLoaded event listener, you ensure that it runs only after the DOM content is fully loaded, including the elements you're trying to access.
