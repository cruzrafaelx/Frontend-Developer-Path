1. Whitespace

- padding and margin: em;
- leading (whitespace between text lines) line-height: em;
- do check the white spaces on top and bottom of elements. Make it equal. For example in containers, make sure white spaces in all corners are equal.
- letter-spacing: 0.7em;

2. Alignment

- process of ensuring that every element is positioned correctly in relation to other elements.
- each element in a UI defines a series of rows and columns

3. Contrast

- strikingly different state from something else. It is true for every element that has a background. 
- WCAG 2.0 (web content accesibility guidelines)
- Minimum AA - visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at leaset 4.5:1, except for large text which should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.
- Enhanced AAA - visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at leaset 7:1, except for large text which should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
- Use contrast checking tools!

4. Scale
- Size of every UI Element must be considered!

5. Typography
- Font choices: use up to 2 font families.
- Visual hierarchy
- Font Size
- Alignment
- Letter spacing & line height
- Font styles (weight, italic)
- Color & contrast

6. Color

7. Visual Hierarchy
- Every element on a user interface has a level of importance. 
- Visual hierarchy is how we establish different level of importance. 
- Use  whitespace, alignment, contrast, color, scale to establish visual hierarchy.
- Use darker shade for less important texts, like p 
- You can also use a darker shade of the background for containers lying on the background.
