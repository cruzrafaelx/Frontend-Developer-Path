1. How to open a hamburger menu from the side.

- get id of hamburger
- connect a click event listener to it, that will add a class to the <nav> 

open.addEventListener('click', () => {
    nav.classList.add('open-nav');
})

- the class should have the following properties:

.open-nav {
    visibility: unset;
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateX(0);
}

This will undo the above properties declared beforehand:

nav {
    position: fixed;
    background: #2C354A;
    height: 100vh;
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
    width: 80%;
    visibility: hidden;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    opacity: 0;
    transition: all .3s;
    text-align: center;
}


2. How to close a side menu:

- get id of exit button
- connect a click event listener to it that will remove the added class:

exit.addEventListener('click', () => {
    nav.classList.remove('open-nav');
})

3. Flex

display: flex;

flexwrap: wrap;
This makes the flex items wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom. Items will overflow into a new line if there is not enough space in the current line.

flex: 0 0 50%;
is a shorthand for three other properties: flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.
Flex-basis sets the initial main size of the item.  In this case to 50%.
