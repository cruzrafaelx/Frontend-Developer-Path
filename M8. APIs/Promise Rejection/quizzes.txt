1. What is a promise (in your own words)?
A promise that an operation that normally takes a bit of time
will eventually finish running. I.O.U. (I owe you)

2. Which part of the code we have so far is a promise?
The fetch request returns a promise object.

3. What are the three states a promise can be in?
(1) Pending, (2) Resolved (fulfilled), (3) Rejected

4. What does it mean when a promise is "resolved" (or fulfilled)?
The task we wanted to perform finished successfully.

5. How do we tell the code to do something only AFTER a
   promise is resolved?
.then() method

6. How do we handle a promise that has been rejected?
 .catch(err => console.log(err ))

7. When is a promise rejected?
- A promise becomes rejected if an error is thrown inside any of the .then() blocks or if a programmer manually calls Promise.reject()
